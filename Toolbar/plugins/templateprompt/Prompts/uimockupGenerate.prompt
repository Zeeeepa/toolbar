Read STRUCTURE.md "REQUIREMENTS" Section:
Add Generated contents to ""REQUIREMENTS""" (create one if it does not exist) section of STRUCTURE.md

Parse the STRUCTURE.md file to extract all requirements listed under the "REQUIREMENTS" section.
Ensure that each requirement is clearly understood in terms of functionality, user interaction, and visual representation.
Ensure Accessibility:

After analyzing the requirements section, when preparing to create UI mockups, please make sure that all the features are properly accessible via the proposed UI's accessibility routes in a logical and rational manner.
Verify that the UI design supports keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and other accessibility standards.
Generate UI Mockups:

For each requirement, create a corresponding UI mockup that visually represents the functionality or feature.
Use the existing UI components and layouts as a foundation, adapting them to match the specific needs of each requirement.
Main Application Layout:

Ensure the main application layout includes all necessary components as per the requirements.
Adjust the layout to accommodate new features or changes specified in the "REQUIREMENTS" section.
Tree Structure View:

Update the tree structure view to reflect any new project hierarchy or components introduced in the requirements.
Ensure the tree is expandable/collapsible and accurately represents the project's structure.
Diagram View with Tabs:

Create or modify diagrams to include any new diagram types or content specified in the requirements.
Ensure the tabbed interface supports all necessary diagram views (e.g., Architecture, Components, Sequence, Data Model).
Chat Interface:

Adapt the chat interface to support any new interactions or features required for user assistance or project management.
Ensure the chat can handle queries related to the new requirements.
Mobile View:

Adjust the mobile view to ensure all new features and requirements are accessible and functional on mobile devices.
Use a tabbed interface to optimize space and usability.
Context Menus:

Update context menus for tree nodes and diagram tabs to include any new actions or options specified in the requirements.
Ensure context menus are intuitive and provide quick access to relevant functions.
Save to SUGGESTED.md:

Document each UI mockup in the SUGGESTED.md file, including visual representations and explanations of how they correspond to the requirements.
Use clear headings and descriptions to organize the mockups and provide context for each design decision.
