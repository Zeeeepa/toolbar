Feature Discovery Prompt
Objective
The primary goal is to conduct a thorough feature discovery analysis based on the project documentation and codebase. This analysis aims to identify the most valuable and effective features for inclusion in the "SUGGESTED" section of the STRUCTURE.md document. The objective is to gather a comprehensive list of features that maximize effectiveness, align with strategic objectives, and address user needs, thereby guiding the selection of required features for further development.

Effectiveness-Prioritized Features
Identification Criteria
Maximum Effectiveness-to-Effort Ratio: Identify features that offer the highest return on investment in terms of effort and resources.
Critical Bottleneck Resolution: Prioritize features that address significant bottlenecks or pain points in the current system.
Technical Debt Reduction: Focus on features that mitigate substantial technical debt, enhancing the system's long-term maintainability.
Leveraging Existing Architecture: Propose enhancements that build upon the current architecture while introducing key improvements that align with the project's goals.
Feature Details
For each feature, provide the following information:

Name: A clear and descriptive name that accurately reflects the feature's purpose.
Purpose: A concise explanation of what the feature aims to achieve and how it addresses specific challenges or opportunities.
Estimated Impact: Assess the anticipated impact of the feature on the system's performance, user experience, and overall value. Categorize the impact as high, medium, or low.
Key Dependencies: List any critical dependencies or prerequisites that must be addressed before the feature can be implemented. This includes both technical and operational dependencies.
