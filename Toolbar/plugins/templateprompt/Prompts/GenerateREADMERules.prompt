Documentation Guidelines for Concurrent Development
STRUCTURE.md:
Purpose: Outlines the current and required high-level structure of the project, serving as the source of truth for required functionality.
Content:

CURRENT Section: Describes the existing structure and marks what parts are complete [X], still needed [ ], or partially implemented [50%].
REQUIRED Section: Details the required functionality and structure to be achieved, serving as the authoritative reference for all development decisions.

Usage: Reflect live project structural changes after every upgrade, branching, or merging.
STEP-BY-STEP.md:
Purpose: Defines a phased implementation plan that maximizes concurrent development by breaking functionality into the smallest possible independent components.
Content: Detailed implementation phases with concurrent components, clear dependencies, and progress tracking.
Rules for Using STRUCTURE.md
*************************  Rules for Using STRUCTURE.md  *************************
Maintain Accuracy:

Ensure STRUCTURE.md accurately reflects the current and required project structure.
Update the "CURRENT" section after every significant change, such as upgrades, branching, or merging.

Clear Markings:

Use clear markings to indicate the completion status of each part:

 for completed sections.
 for sections still needed.
[50%] for partially implemented sections.



Component Granularity:

Break down functionality in the "REQUIRED" section into clear, distinct components.
Ensure components are defined with enough detail to understand their purpose and boundaries.
Be explicit about relationships between components where relevant.

Review Regularly:

Review STRUCTURE.md regularly to ensure alignment with project goals and progress.
Update the "REQUIRED" section as new functionalities or structural changes are identified.

Rules for Using STEP-BY-STEP.md
*************************  Rules for Using STEP-BY-STEP.md  *************************
Use the STEP-BY-STEP.md file to define a concurrent development plan and track progress. Follow these guidelines:
Plan for Maximum Concurrency:

Organize implementation into phases based on dependencies between components.
Maximize the number of components that can be developed simultaneously within each phase.
Target 5-10 concurrent components per phase based on team capacity.
Clearly identify dependencies to prevent unnecessary blocking.

Structure Format:

Organize by implementation phases, with each phase containing multiple concurrent components.
For each component, include:

Clear description of functionality
Explicit dependencies on previous components (if any)
Implementation guidelines
Validation criteria
Reference to STRUCTURE.md REQUIRED section



Track Progress:

Use status markers for each component:

 Not started
[IP] In progress (with optional % complete)
 Completed
[B] Blocked (include reason and dependencies)


Update component status whenever progress is made.

Phase Transition:

Only begin a new phase when all blocking dependencies from previous phases are completed.
Components within a phase can be started as soon as their specific dependencies are met.
Document any adjustments to the dependency graph as development progresses.

Example Structure:
markdown# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation (MM/DD/YYYY - MM/DD/YYYY)
*All components in this phase have no dependencies and can be developed simultaneously*

### [X] Component 1.1: User Authentication API
- Functionality: Handles user login, registration, and token validation
- Dependencies: None
- Reference: STRUCTURE.md REQUIRED Section 2.1

### [IP] Component 1.2: UI Component Library
- Functionality: Core UI elements used throughout the application
- Dependencies: None
- Reference: STRUCTURE.md REQUIRED Section 3.4

[Additional concurrent components...]

## Phase 2: Core Features (MM/DD/YYYY - MM/DD/YYYY)
*These components depend only on components from Phase 1*

### [ ] Component 2.1: User Dashboard
- Functionality: Main user interface after login
- Dependencies: Component 1.1, Component 1.2
- Reference: STRUCTURE.md REQUIRED Section 4.2

[Additional concurrent components...]
Integration Strategy:

Document how components will be integrated once developed.
Define interface contracts between dependent components.
Specify any mock implementations that can be used to unblock development.

Adaptation:

Review and adjust the plan as development progresses.
Split components further if additional concurrency opportunities are identified.
Combine components if dependencies prove tighter than initially assessed.

Goal:
The goal is to create a development plan that maximizes parallel work by breaking functionality into independent components organized into dependency-based phases. This approach allows multiple team members to work concurrently with minimal blocking, reducing overall development time while ensuring all required functionality is implemented correctly.
