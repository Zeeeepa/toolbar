## Code Quality

| Aspect | Toolbar Implementation | Toolkit Implementation | Notes |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| Modularity | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Good | Toolkit has better separation of concerns |
| Error Handling | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Comprehensive | Toolkit has better error handling |
| Documentation | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Better | Toolkit has more docstrings |
| Type Hints | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ More complete | Toolkit has better type annotations |
| Logging | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Comprehensive | Toolkit has better logging |

## Conclusion

The Toolkit implementation of the GitHub plugin is generally more robust, modular, and feature-rich compared to the Toolbar implementation. It has better separation of concerns, more comprehensive error handling, and more configurable options. The Toolkit implementation should be used as the base for the consolidated implementation, with any unique features from the Toolbar implementation incorporated as needed.
